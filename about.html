			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p>I'm J-C! I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2015 with a major in psychology and a minor in business. I spent some time in HR, but realized that wasn't where I wasn't where I wanted to spend the rest of my life.</p>

			<h2>What do I want to do?</h2>
			<p>I want to make websites, of course! Too many websites have awkard, unintuitive, and generally not user-friendly layouts.  I want to design websites that look great and are easy to understand.</p>
			<p>Eventually I want to make video games, but... baby steps.</p>
